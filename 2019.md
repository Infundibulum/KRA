1. (a) What are the ingredients contituting a Turing machine (Tm),
and what restrictions on these ingredients make the Tm
a finite state machine (fsm)?

A Turing machine (Tm) M is a 5-tuple [MRight, MLeft, Write, Halt, Q0], and if we restrict MLeft=[], Write=[], and the set of halting transitions are of the form [Q,#], where # is the blank symbol, then it is an FSM.
In this encoding, the # symbol terminates the input string.


1. (b) What does it mean for a Tm to be non-deterministic?
Why does depth-first search suffice to process the non-detirminism of
an fsm, but is inadequate for a non-deterministic Tm in general?
Describe an alternative to depth-first search
that suffices for an arbitrary non-deterministic Tm.

A Tm is non-deterministic when at a given state and with
a given symbol, there may exist multiple legal transitions.

For a non-determisitic FSM, depth-first search will eventually
terminate because the string input to the FSM is finite and
the number of possible transitions from a given state is finite.
Since an FSM processes 1 symbol at each tick, the recursive
application of the FSM always tends towards the base case of
processing the empty string.
